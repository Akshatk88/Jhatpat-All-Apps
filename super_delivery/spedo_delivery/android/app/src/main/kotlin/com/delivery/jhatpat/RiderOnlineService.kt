/**
 * Keeps the app's process alive for as long as the rider is online.
 *
 * This is the piece that separates our behaviour from Zomato/Swiggy/Uber, and it
 * fixes two things that were previously worked around rather than solved:
 *
 *  - GPS going stale. Android freezes a backgrounded process, so location updates
 *    stopped whenever the rider left the app on screen. The backend then treated
 *    them as stale and dropped them from dispatch, which meant no push, which meant
 *    nothing to wake the app to refresh the GPS — a loop the rider could not escape
 *    without reopening the app. The staleness window was widened to 45 minutes to
 *    paper over it; this addresses the cause.
 *
 *  - The overlay engine cold-starting on every order. With the process alive the
 *    Flutter engine stays warm, so the incoming-order UI has far less to do before
 *    it can paint.
 *
 * A foreground service is the ONLY supported way to ask Android not to reap a
 * process. The permanent notification is not decoration — it is the price Android
 * charges, and the contract that makes the guarantee hold.
